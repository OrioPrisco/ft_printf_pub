# ft_printf_pub

The public version of my printf project for 42.  
Most of the history is missing because the norminette require to put your name in the header, meaning i would need to rebase the entire history and change all the headers. I might do it if I find a way to automate this, but for now only the source code is available.  
This is an archive see https://github.com/OrioPrisco/ft_printf for the full history
